===In ELITE QUOTE 0.7===

This version will turn Elite Quote into an apparently OSX Native application since it seems
my small user base are mostly OSX users. I considered re-writing the application in
objective-C and Cocoa but I don't think there's any point as I'm far more comfortable with
and experienced in swing.

 # Menu Bar moved to apple menu bar
 # Application name appears correctly under OSX as Elite Quote and not PriceCalculator(The name of the main Class)
 # Icon appears on Dock
 # Program released in a .dmg

===In ELITE QUOTE 0.8===

 # Ability to e-mail quotes straight from the program
 # Ability to create printer friendly quote
