This version will turn Elite Quote into an apparently OSX Native application since it seems
my small user base are mostly OSX users. I considered re-writing the application in
objective-C and Cocoa but I don't think there's any point as I'm far more comfortable with
and experienced in swing.

 # ~~Menu Bar moved to apple menu bar~~
 # ~~Application name appears correctly under OSX as Elite Quote and not PriceCalculator(The name of the main Class)~~
 # ~~Icon appears on Dock~~
 # ~~Program released in a .dmg~~
 # ~~JAR Packaged as .app~~
